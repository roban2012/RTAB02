	<br><br>Young Hitler was a failed artist before he turned to a darker course.<br><br>
"His daily activity was to go out and paint - he was penniless," he said. <br><br>
"He tried to get into an academy in Vienna to pursue a career as a professional artist but had two applications turned down. 
"He simply wasn't good enough, particularly when drawing people the perspective was all wrong." <br><br>
If he'd been given a place in the academy the most we'd ever heard of Adolf Hitler would have been that he was a routine artist painting some nice landscapes, Roban siad. <br><br>
"Researchers believe because he was rejected, it could have turned his mind into deep resentment and eventually into monster he became." <br><br>
