Alexandre Kojève  was a Russian-born French philosopher and statesman whose philosophical seminars had an immense influence on 20th-century French philosophy, particularly via his integration of Hegelian concepts into continental philosophy. As a statesman in the French government, he was instrumental in the creation of the European Union. Kojève was a close friend of, and was in lifelong philosophical dialogue with, Leo Strauss.	<br><br>
法兰西斯 福山（Francis Fukuyama）生于1952年10月27日，日裔美籍学者。哈佛大学政治学博士，现任约翰霍普金斯大学、保罗 尼采高级国际问题研究院、舒华兹讲座、国际政治经济学教授，曾师从塞缪尔 亨廷顿。曾任美国国务院思想库「政策企划局」副局长。著有《历史之终结与最后一人》、《后人类未来──基因工程的人性浩劫》、《跨越断层──人性与社会秩序重建》、《信任》、《政治秩序的起源：从前人类时代到法国大革命》。他的第一本著作《历史之终结与最后一人》让他一举成名。 	<br><br>
福山本是施特劳斯派（保守派）弟子（布鲁姆的学生），但他在施特劳斯与科耶夫的辩论（“古今之争”）中更多采取科耶夫的“现代”立场，因此他不但明言继承黑格尔――科耶夫的问题（“现代性”――“承认的政治”――“全球性普世一体化国家”――“历史的终结”）逻辑，并是用通俗的当代流行语言重新包装了科耶夫。	<br><br>
亚历山大 科耶夫（Alexandre Kojeve, 1902―1968 ），法国哲学家、外交家，生于俄国，在海德堡 Heidelberg大学读书。存在主义的新黑格尔主义的代表，提出”历史的终结不是在未来，而是在过去“。 Kojeve是康定斯基Kandinsky的侄子，1919年离开苏俄，前往德国。在德国，他靠做生意来维持生活，同时研究哲学。1926年，他获得了海德堡大学的博士学位。Kojeve的导师德国精神病学家、哲学家卡尔 雅斯贝尔斯，雅斯贝尔斯是除马丁 海德格尔之外，哲学界现象学派最重要的代表之一，而现象学派就是他们的老师埃德蒙 胡塞尔创立的。	<br><br>
亚历山大 科耶夫是一位谜一般的人物，他家庭富有，与政界关系密切，拥有着哲学家与外交官双重身份――他久享哲学盛誉，却从不追求学术职业；他讲授了六年“历史终结”，最后却转战政界；他致力于维护法国、欧洲以及不发达国家的利益，但从未放弃过哲学思考。	<br><br>
1967年，西柏林的学生运动领袖们满怀崇敬地向 Kojeve 请教革命之道。刚从北京访问归来的 Kojeve 给出的主要建议是：“学习希腊语”。	<br><br>
“学习希腊语”。	<br><br>
科耶夫的古怪建议或许只有他自己才能解释，因为他曾经说过：“早在2400年以前希腊发生的一些事，其实是一切事情的缘起与答案。”这让人想起伽达默尔（德语 Gadamer，1900年 －2002年）的话：“基本上，我只看2000年以前的书。”	<br><br>
Leo Strauss 的美国弟子们在小布什那里登堂入室，被称为新保守主义政治的教父。Leo Strauss和Kojeve早在20年代的德国就认识，两人的学术方向截然不同，但施特劳斯终其一生都坚持将他重要文章的打印稿寄给Kojeve。	<br><br>
科耶夫的新拉丁帝国是半个世纪前的国际战略构想，当时正是美利坚帝国与苏联帝国两强争霸，科耶夫为了伸张欧洲的国际政治地位，提出在新的时代欧洲必须组成联合体以在苏美两强的夹缝中找到自身的生存空间。然而冷战以后苏维埃帝国的瓦解和中国的崛起已经深刻改变了世界，毛泽东有词云： 安得倚天抽宝剑把汝裁为三截 一截遗欧 一截赠美 一截还东国，太平世界 环球同此凉热。	<br><br>

Alexandre Kojève (April 28, 1902 C June 4, 1968) was a Russian-born French philosopher and statesman whose philosophical seminars had an immense influence on 20th-century French philosophy, particularly via his integration of Hegelian concepts into continental philosophy. As a statesman in the French government, he was instrumental in the creation of the European Union. Kojève was a close friend of, and was in lifelong philosophical dialogue with, Leo Strauss.	<br><br>
Life 	<br><br>
Kojève was born Aleksandr Vladimirovic Kozevnikov   in Russia to a wealthy and influential family. His uncle was the abstract artist Wassily Kandinsky, about whose work he would write an influential essay in 1936. He was educated in Berlin and Heidelberg, Germany. He completed his PhD, on the Russian religious philosopher Vladimir Soloviev's views on the union of God and man in Christ under the direction of Karl Jaspers. Early influences included the philosopher Martin Heidegger and the historian of science Alexandre Koyre. Kojève spent most of his life in France, and from 1933 to 1939, he delivered in Paris a series of lectures on Georg Hegel's work Phenomenology of Spirit. After World War II, Kojève worked in the French Ministry of Economic Affairs as one of the chief planners of the European Common Market.	<br><br>
Kojève was an extraordinarily learned man. A polyglot通晓多种语言的人, he studied and used Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, Latin, and Classical Greek. He was also fluent in French, German, Russian, and English.	<br><br>
Kojève died in Brussels in 1968, shortly after giving a talk at the European Economic Community (now the European Union) on behalf of the French government. In his later years, he had repeatedly expressed the position that what Marx called the European proletariat最下层阶级，工人阶级，尤指无产阶级no longer existed, and the wealthy West sorely needed to help developing countries to overcome widespread poverty through large monetary gifts similar to the Marshall Plan.	<br><br>
Philosophy 	<br><br>
Though not a Marxist, Kojeve was known as an influential and idiosyncratic interpreter of Hegel, reading him through the lens of both Marx and Heidegger. The well-known "End of History" thesis advanced the idea that ideological history in a limited sense had ended with the French Revolution and the regime of Napoleon and that there was no longer a need for violent struggle to establish the "rational supremacy of the regime of rights and equal recognition." Kojeve's "End of History" is different from Francis Fukayama's later thesis of the same name in that it points as much to a socialist-capitalist synthesis as to a triumph of liberal capitalism.	<br><br>
Some of Kojève's more important lectures on Hegel have been published in English in the now classic Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on Phenomenology of Spirit, in 1947. Kojève's interpretation of Hegel has been one of the most influential of the past century. His lectures were attended by a small but influential group of intellectuals including Raymond Queneau, Georges Bataille, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Andre Breton, Jacques Lacan, and Raymond Aron. His interpretation of the master-slave dialectic was an important influence on Jacques Lacan's mirror stage theory. Other French thinkers who have acknowledged his influence on their thought include the post-structuralist philosophers Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.	<br><br>
Kojeve's correspondence with Leo Strauss has been published along with Kojève's critique of Strauss's commentary on Xenophon's Hiero (see below on their friendship and debate). In the 1950s, Kojève also met the rightist legal theorist (and former Nazi) Carl Schmitt, whose "Concept of the Political" he had implicitly criticized in his analysis of Hegel's text on "Lordship and Bondage奴役，束缚." Another close friend was the Jesuit Hegelian philosopher Gaston Fessard.	<br><br>

Alexandre Kojeve: The Roots of Postmodern Politics	<br><br>
 (英语) 平装 C 1994年8月15日 	<br><br>
Shadia B. Drury 	<br><br>
 Alexandre Kojve (1902-1968) was Hegel's most famous interpreter, reading Hegel through the eyes of Marx and Heidegger simultaneously. The result was a wild if not hypnotic催眠的术的melange混合物 of ideas. In this book, Drury reveals the nature of Kojve's Hegelianism and the extraordinary influence it has had on French postmodernists on the left (Raymond Queneau, Georges Bataille, and Michel Foucault) and American postmodernists on the right (Leo Strauss, Allan Bloom, and Francis Fukuyama). According to Drury, Kojve followed Hegel in thinking that reason has triumphed in the course of history, but it is a cold, soulless, instrumental, and uninspired rationalism that has conquered and disenchanted the world. Drury maintains that Kojve's conception of modernity as the fateful triumph of this arid rationality is the cornerstone of postmodern thought. Kojve's picture of the world gives birth to a dark romanticism that manifests itself in a profound nostalgia for what reason has banished - myth, madness, disorder, spontaneity, instinct, passion, and virility. In Drury's view, these ideas romanticize the gratuitous免费的，无偿的；无必要的；无故的，无理由的violence and irrationalism that characterize the postmodern world.	<br><br>

亚历山大 科耶夫，一个谜一般的人物。他对后现代思想的影响如此知名，却鲜被理解。同时透过马克思和海德格尔的双重视角来阅读黑格尔，科耶夫创造出了一套狂野的理论，如果说不是一种催眠般的混合物的话。在这本书中，德鲁里展示了科耶夫的黑格尔主义的本质，和对法国、美国所有知识分子的非凡影响。	<br><br>
根据德鲁里的说法，科耶夫认为历史是一场悲剧，上演着冷酷、无情、工具性的和没有感情的理性主义如何征服这个世界的故事。德鲁里认为，科耶夫将现代性观念视为乏味理性的决定性胜利，这构成了后现代思想的基石。	<br><br>
从科耶夫提供的这种世界图像中诞生了一种隐晦的浪漫主义，它表现为一种深刻的怀旧。早巳被理性摒弃的东西诸如荒诞、疯狂、混乱、冲动、本能、激情和膂力，被重新拾起。在德鲁里看来，这些理念浪漫化了无故暴力和反理性主义，而正是它们塑造了后现代世界。 	<br><br>

参考书目 	<br><br>
In addition to his lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit, Kojève published other articles and books, including a little noticed book on Immanuel Kant, and articles on the relationship between Hegelian and Marxist thought and Christianity. His 1943 book, Esquisse d'une phenomenologie du droit, published posthumously in 1981, contrasts the aristocratic and bourgeois views of the right. Le Concept, le temps et le discours, extrapolates on the Hegelian notion that wisdom only becomes possible in the fullness of time. Kojève's response to Leo Strauss, who disputed this notion, can be found in Kojève's article "The Emperor Julian and his Art of Writing".	<br><br>
Kojève also challenged Strauss' interpretation of the classics in the voluminous Esquisse d'une histoire raisonnee de la pensee paienne, which covers the pre-Socratic philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, and Neoplatonism. Recently, three more books have been published: a 1932 thesis on the physical and philosophical importance of quantum physics, an extended 1931 essay on atheism ("L'atheisme"), and a 1943 work on "The Notion of Authority."	<br><br>
Friendship with Strauss	<br><br>
Kojève had a close and lifelong friendship with Leo Strauss which began when they were philosophy students in Berlin. The two shared a deep philosophical respect for each other. Kojève would later write that he "never would have known[...] what philosophy is" without Strauss. In the 1930s the two began a debate on the relation of philosophy to politics that would come to fruition with Kojeve's response to Strauss' On Tyranny. Kojève, a senior statesman in the French government, argued that philosophers should have an active part in shaping political events. Strauss, on the other hand, believed that philosophy and politics were fundamentally opposed, and that philosophers should not have a substantial role in politics, noting the disastrous results of Plato in Syracuse. Philosophers should influence politics only to the extent that they can ensure that philosophical contemplation remains free from the seduction诱惑；引诱and coercion强迫；高压政治of power. In spite of this debate, Strauss and Kojève remained friendly. In fact, Strauss would send his best students to Paris to finish their education under Kojève's personal guidance. Among these were Allan Bloom, who endeavored to make Kojève's works available in English (and published the first edition of Kojève's lectures in English), and Stanley Rosen.	<br><br>

The publication of this meticulously accurate translation, of the genuinely classic work of a towering figure of twentieth century political philosophy, marks a major event in the world of English-speaking scholarship-which will finally have to come to terms with the challenge of Kojeve's highly original and uncompromisingly rationalist left-Hegelian phenomenology of justice. (Thomas Pangle, University of Toronto)	<br><br>
I found the translation of Kojeve's Outline of a Phenomenology of Right quite impressive. The translators have remained remarkably faithful to the original, even maintaining much of Kojeve's sentence structure, punctuation, and literary idiosyncracies while conveying this difficult work in a surprisingly clear and accessible translation. The editor's notes are excellently done, clarifying allusions in the text, explaining obscure references and noting ambiguities in the French original. Bryan Paul Frost and Robert Howse have provided the kind of translation and editorial apparatus made possible both by a fine grasp of the French language and by a deep familiarity with Kojeve's philosophical work as well as the broader tradition of legal and political philosophy. (Daniel Mahoney, Assumption College)	<br><br>
Kojeve was one of the last century's most influential philosophers, yet one of the least known to the public. This work, unpublished by the author, displays the principles and features of the 'universal and homogeneous state'―a state never seen but often presupposed by politicians as well as thinkers. Every reader deeply interested in today's politics will want this book.... (Harvey Mansfield, professor of government, Harvard University)	<br><br>
Admirers of Alexandre Kojeve's influential Introduction to the Reading of Hegel will be especially grateful for the publication of this translation of his Outline of a Phenomenology of Right. It renders more concrete many of the tantalizing arguments of that earlier work and should also serve to enrich our impoverished contemporary debate over globalization. (Nathan Tarcov, University of Chicago)	<br><br>
This translation merits high praise for its scrupulous care and precision. It is sufficiently literal to give the reader the confidence that Kojeve's argument has been faithfully conveyed, but sufficiently well-polished in its English to be no less readable than the French. (James Nichols Claremont Review of Books)	<br><br>
Kojeve's work is always brilliant, and this particular work . . . expounds a very noteworthy position. . . . A highly original articulation of a unique and penetrating philosophical position. (Donald J. Maletz,, University of Oklahoma)	<br><br>

Every reader deeply interested in today's politics will want this book. (Harvey Mansfield, professor of government, Harvard University)	<br><br>
Outline of a Phenomenology of Right is an impressive and exhaustive effort that seeks to clarify the meaning of droit. The book, by Alexandre Kojève, not only unpacks the term, but in the process layers droit with Hegelian and Marxist historiography such that the reader is offered a rich historical understanding of droit that is both challenging and thought provoking. Readers can take away from this book an appreciation for the interconnectedness of law, justice, morality, rights, and the role of the state and political institutions in giving meaning to these terms.

Language Notes	<br><br>
Text: English (translation)	<br><br>
 Original Language: French --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title. 	<br><br>
This is a remarkable work by the author that originated the `End of History' debate. Kojeve is perhaps most famous (in the English-speaking world) for his argument with Leo Strauss in `On Tyranny' and also his interpretation of Hegel in his `Introduction to the Reading of Hegel', which was a collection of notes to a course given by Kojeve in the thirties. This work (the `Introduction') can be correctly described as one of the first exercises in existential-Marxism thanks to its groundbreaking mixture of Hegel, Heidegger and Marx.	<br><br>
It (the `Introduction') is a very `dramatic' reading of Hegel in which Masters rise to mastery thanks to their willingness to fight, kill and die while those not as willing sink to the level of Slaves. The driving force in this struggle, btw, is neither Reason nor mere animal need but the all-to-human Desire for Recognition. But this is not the last word: mastery is an impasse; it goes nowhere, it can only reenact endlessly the Fight that created it. Slavery, however, through Work changes both the world and the slaves themselves. Thus Kojeve is correct to say that History is the history of the working slave. This struggle between Masters and Slaves dialectically unfolds until the appearance of the French Revolution, whose `Freedom, Equality, Fraternity' goes forth to change the world by bringing Recognition to all. It is Kojeve's contention that we have been living in post-history since that Revolution - in which History technically ended - with nothing happening except the rest of the world being brought into line with the Ideals of the Revolution. Thus Kojeve says (of Hegel, though he could have said it of himself too) that Hegel "definitely reconciles himself with all that is and has been, by declaring that there will never more be anything new on earth."	<br><br>
This line of thought is later made famous by Fukuyama in his popular book `The End of History and the Last Man'. Fukuyama reminds us that the `End of History' must mean, thanks to the cessation of Human Desire (struggle for recognition), a return to `animality'. This animality, of course, is the `Last Man' Nietzsche's Zarathustra so memorably mocks - `we have invented happiness' the last men recite, and then fall asleep. The argument between Strauss-Kojeve in `On Tyranny' boils down, after one strips away the exoteric, to the possibility that philosophy will be impossible in the Universal Homogenous State (UHS) that rises at the end of our post-history. Kojeve, in the end, bites the bullet and concedes that the Sages aren't philosophers properly understood; all they (the Sages) can do is reiterate, publicly or in their own minds, the process that led eventually, but necessarily, to them. Philosophy dies in the shadow of an Absolute and Circular Truth (i.e., absolute, unchanging; circular, no matter where one begins ones investigation one always ends with the same Truth) and never rises again.	<br><br>
It is with all this baggage (and doubtless more) that we English-speaking readers of Kojeve then turn to the Outline in the hope of some clarification of the myriad issues we are familiar with. Be prepared for a shock, the `Outline' has pretty much eschewed (or toned down) all talk of animality, tyranny, Sages, Desire and so forth. The translators, Frost and Howse, in their excellent introduction go so far as to characterize, I think correctly, the final goal of the Kojevean History (the full replacement of the rule of men by the rule of law) as a hyper-liberalism! The final state (UHS) rises, not through the dramatic confrontation between Masters and Slaves fighting over their Humanity but through the integration of economies and the syncing up of legal systems that comes along with it, i.e. globalization. It is certainly not the compelling and dramatic story of necessary tyranny and unrequited Desire that Kojeve (in)famously made in both the `Introduction' and the discussion with Strauss. (Kojeve, an admirer of Stalin, was capable of writing sentences comparing (and indeed, justifying) the rise of communism and Hitler insofar as both, in spite of what they intended, led, in fact, to further democratization! See Kojeve's `Introduction', p160, note.) However, this book, the `Outline', does nothing of the sort. It is a brilliant but measured technical study of the forces set loose by modern capitalism that lead, inevitably, to a global State. ...It is seemingly a book for technocrats - and technocrats only. One comes away with the impression that, for Kojeve, the modern world is a system of forces searching for equilibrium. The UHS is that unending equilibrium.	<br><br>
But why is there such a seeming disconnect between (at the very least!) the tone of the Outline and that of the Introduction? While it can be argued that Kojeve changed his mind about these matters I would say that Kojeve, an esoteric writer (like Leo Strauss) himself, intended these two books for very different audiences and very different purposes. The present work, the Outline, is intended to show those of us living in Posthistoire - remember, history `ended' for Kojeve with the French Revolution, our present post-history is the struggle to actualize the Ideals of the Revolution throughout the world; that actualization, when attained, is the UHS - what remains to be done. The `Introduction', by contrast, shows us how to think of this posthistoire. Thus the `Introduction' is propaganda, the `Outline' is plan.	<br><br>
The `Introduction', btw, does not necessarily put forth the `final form' of propaganda in the UHS. As Kojeve told Strauss:	<br><br>
Historical action necessarily leads to a specific result (hence: deduction), but the ways that lead to this result, are varied (all roads lead to Rome!). The choice between these ways is free, and this choice determines the content of the speeches about the action and the meaning of the result. In other words: materially history is unique, but the spoken story can be extremely varied, depending on the free choice of how to act. (On Tyranny, p 256).	<br><br>
Thus `ideological' differences between the `Introduction' and the `Outline' are not significant for Kojeve. The `Introduction' presented a possible version of what to say; the `Outline' tells us what to do. ...This is Kojeve's strict modernism. The ancients and some moderns would append a cosmology to the system - something to dream about. Hegel has a philosophy of nature and a theology; his student Kojeve has neither. Plato writes a Timaeus, Nietzsche a Zarathustra; Kojeve does nothing of the sort. Only time will tell if this fidelity to the radical, atheistic Enlightenment will cost him everything.	<br><br>
This is a very readable translation with an excellent introduction, kudos to Frost and Howse!	<br><br>

《科耶夫的新拉丁帝国》中充分利用了西方学界整理旧故的稳妥成就，对科耶夫等的著作进行了解释，并向有解释深度的细读方面迈进，相信可以推进学界对西方思想大传统的深度理解。翻译西方学界诠释西学经典的论著，充分利用西方学界整理旧故的稳妥成就，於庚续清末以来学界理解西方思想传统的未尽之业意义重大。设计这套“西方传统：经典与解释”，旨在推进学界对西方思想大传统的深度理解。选题除顾及诸多亟待填补的研究空白（包括一些经典著作的翻译），尤其注重选择思想大家和笃行纯学的思想史家对经典的解读。	<br><br>
西方思想经典即便都译成了汉语，并不等于汉语学界有了解读能力，西学典籍的汉译历史虽然仅仅百年，积累已经不菲，而学界的读解似乎仍然在吃夹生饭――甚至吃生米，消化不了。《科耶夫的新拉丁帝国》正是出于这点而编写的。书中充分利用了西方学界整理旧故的稳妥成就，对科耶夫等的著作进行了解释，并向有解释深度的细读方面迈进，相信可以推进学界对西方思想大传统的深度理解。	<br><br>

科耶夫的新拉丁帝国是半个世纪前的国际战略构想，当时正是美利坚帝国与苏联帝国两强争霸，科耶夫为了伸张欧洲的国际政治地位，提出在新的时代欧洲必须组成联合体以在苏美两强的夹缝中找到自身的生存空间。然而冷战以后苏维埃帝国的瓦解和中国的崛起已经深刻改变了世界，毛泽东有词云： 安得倚天抽宝剑把汝裁为三截 一截遗欧 一截赠美 一截还东国，太平世界 环球同此凉热。 	<br><br>

## 纵横家科耶夫	<br><br>
在欧美学界，随着施米特和施特劳斯研究的兴起，科耶夫作为跟两位思想家均有密切来往和深刻对话关系的思想家，也逐渐受到重视，研究文献日见增多。由我承乏编译的这个选本，便是围绕科耶夫的“拉丁帝国”理念，搜集相关研究论著而成。	<br><br>
“拉丁帝国”是一个跟国际政治有关的理念，科耶夫提出这个理念是在第二次世界大战即将结束的1945年，是在他写给当时法国政治领袖戴高乐的建言书《法国国是纲要》里面（科耶夫的不甘寂寞和用世野心人所共知――据伯林说，他其实也给斯大林写过人民来信，但结果是泥牛人海无消息）。在这份颇具纵横家气息的建言书中，科耶夫对当时的国际格局做出了判断：苏联和美国作为两个巨大的政治实体，已经超越了传统政治学和国际法理念所约定俗成的“民族国家”的界限，形成两个可以对全球施加影响的“帝国”。尽管“冷战”和“两极对立”之类名词的出笼还得再等些时日，但明眼人都可以看出，所有国家最终都得在这样一种格局之下，在两个“帝国”的勾心斗角之中重新考虑自己的位置和前途。 	<br><br>
文摘	<br><br>
由法国所支持的、出于造就一个拉丁帝国的目的所进行的政治和经济投入，不能够并且也不应该没有天主教会的支持，因为天主教会所代表的那种力量，尽管非常难以估计并且也更加难以利用，但毕竟是极其庞大的。	<br><br>
毫无疑问，正是天主教塑造并且表述出了一些最重要的原动力，这些原动力至今仍然是整个法兰西生活――也包括一般意义上的拉丁生活――的深层的精神资源。因此，非常自然也非常正常的是，政府会试图使帝国的、与世俗性的和世俗化的天主教（secular and Secularized catholicism）有关的行为，与这同一个天主教在教会当中或者通过梵蒂冈所发现的那些表述相互协调。	<br><br>
Richelieu - von Metternich C乔冠华 Kissinger	<br><br>
Kojève苏秦张仪鬼谷子纵横捭阖，简单看看黄易的《寻秦记》就得。	<br><br>
但是，要想成功地开创一个帝国，必须要有两个前提，一个是必须要对拉丁世界的政府进行激进的改革，另外一个是必须要对天主教会进行深刻的改造，尤其是必须要对意大利和西班牙境内的分支教会进行改造。首先是必须要将梵蒂冈“去意大利化（de-Italianize）”，但同时又不能把它暴露在就总体而言排他性过强的美国教会的影响面前。这就意味着，法国，还有后来的拉丁帝国，必须要给天主教会的中央和国际组织提供物质上的支持。但这同时也意味着，梵蒂冈必须要克制自己对于法国教会的那种牵涉到教义以及其他一些方面的猜忌，同时也要认识到，它期盼已久的拉丁联盟只有通过那种由法国发起并且由法国加以规划的行动，才能够产生出来。而人们也可以期望，为了获得那些对于将天主教从分裂和限制当中解放出来而言是必不可少的力量，天主教会既可以利用自身的天主教义，也可以利用拉丁世界的理念，因为这些分裂和限制有两个来源，一个是外在于基督教的“民族主义的”因素，另外一个则是伴随这种因素而来的那些经济与社会形式。	<br><br>
实际上，正是因为教会的“天主教信仰”，所以，它才总是能够超越强加在民族头上并且也是通过民族来强加的各种不同的框架模式，不管是哪一种模式。但是，它也经历过“反民族”斗争所带来的激烈反应。 	<br><br>
亚历山大 科耶夫:哲学、国家与历史的终结 	<br><br>
平装 C 2013年9月1日 	<br><br>
多米尼克 奥弗莱 (作者),    张尧均	<br><br>
20世纪的欧洲思想家，恐怕没有谁的命运像亚里山大 科耶夫那样奇异：他久享哲学盛誉，却从不追求学术职业；他讲授了六年“历史终结”，最后却转战政界；他致力于维护法国、欧洲以及不发达国家的利益，但从未放弃过哲学思考。	<br><br>
多米尼克 奥弗莱的传记致力于重塑这一无与伦比的人物的命运与传说。我们从中既发现科耶夫逸文遗稿的回响，也听到他曾思考与经历过的时代的喧嚣。本书不同于一般传记惯用的单纯的历史编纂，也并非对主人公精神发展史的简单梳理，而是让科耶夫的思想与特定的时代、环境和事件穿插对接，进而对他的整个人生和思想历程予以重构，通过现象学令人缭乱的叙事，重新解读多重分裂的科耶夫，深刻揭示整整一代欧洲知识分子的精神历程。	<br><br>

译后记 	<br><br>
序言	<br><br>
为了更好地理解科耶夫是个什么样的人，应该透过他年轻时的经历、他对形而上学的关注、他在俄国的流放遭遇以及他在德国和法国的定居生活来阐释他的思想的发生。	<br><br>
 我们有意地避免写成关于心理描述的心理学传记，而更愿意采用一种假定的现象学方法，同时又不放弃连续发展的视角，这种视角表明或意味着将来优先于现在和过去，而不是由现在和过去预定。15岁或17岁的科耶夫不是30岁或60岁的科耶夫。这不是回避其年轻时所做或所写的理由！从某种方式来说，实存的每一个环节都是先前环节的结果，因为它们为它提供了种种可能性，这就是现实，但只是一方面；另一方面，在先前环节中显现出来的人的主观辩证法又在某个环节的各种可能性中确定了不可能的因素或可实现的因素。使生命在实存上统一的条件与使之中断、断裂、拉开距离、倒退或提前的条件是一样的，因为现实与主体性的不可分性实际上反而使得自我与“对象”、意识与世界及时间与筹划之间的关系变得松弛了。	<br><br>
 在某个特定的环节，各种开放的可能性为传记作者提供了构想的空间，但他应该认识到，是随之而来的环节才使他得以模拟(mimesis)从可能到其实现的过渡。人们可以满足于描述这样一种过渡，就好像涉及的是一个事实，或不需说明理由就能观察到它。但界定这种事实就已经是一种重构；正因如此，最好是通过把人们对这一事实所具有的经验表象引向思想的范畴来说明它，这些范畴是这一事实经由其自身的去现实化(d6r6alisation)而产生的。	<br><br>
 因为思想不仅仅是对事实世界的去现实化，它还是对这一事实世界的理智构造，这种构造使我们得以理解甚至超越这一事实世界的给定现实。停留于对事实的重构中，就好像在注意到事实之后，事实就拥有了一种与使我们得以理解它的诸范畴相分离的客观性，就好像在人的世界中，任何事实尽管已被纳入其本质上是主观的维度中，却不会通过取消它自身的时空特征而落入各种范畴中，这将是对事实的遮蔽。因为，如埃里克 韦耶(Eric Well)所说，对一个事实来说，一个事实不会经由其自身成为一个事实。	<br><br>
 回到科耶夫，我们所采取的方法只有到最后才能被证实，因为他本人将为我们提供它的合理性。“意义”一开始就能显现，却无法证明，但这是因为它_只有在它能为其自身提供证明时才是其所是。这就是为什么，它的存在理由只有在它的结果(参我们的前言)中才能充分地被指明。	<br><br>
 目前，就对科耶夫的生平进行理智的重构(就像我们在开始时设想的那样)而言，这一方法论的观点似乎过于理论化了。但为了避免误解，我们应当一开始就标明或确定我们的意向。为了理解下面的章节，为了较为正确地圈定这个“神秘的”科耶夫，读者应该始终牢记这一点，因为去理解这样一个在许多人眼里曾是“不可理解的”的人(而且现在依然如此)，并且直达其最隐秘的内心，这是一件特别有趣的事。至少，如果它是可能的。但也正因如此，我们的哲学意向将不满足于提供证据或通常意义上的事实，也就是说，不满足于过于拘泥文献的实证研究。(这正是哲学家的工作不同于历史学家的工作的地方。)简言之，我们想要避免单纯的资料汇编式的历史编纂学(不管是事件性的还是心理探究式的)，尤其要避免大事记式的编年叙述。	<br><br>
 继本书开篇提供。的人物草图之后，我们将进一步勾画他的“角色”(“figure”/Gestah)；这个比草图更加主观的“角色”是假定性的，但它将竭力完善自己，从而在最后达至完成时它将变成自为。因此，接下来的某些篇章具有明显的传奇性的特征。	<br><br>
 科耶夫力图实现他自己的“角色”，实现所有的“角色”。他力图成为一个智慧者。无论如何，问题在于理解科耶夫的“角色”，并就这个“角色”提出各种最主观的假设，如我们在他的作品中所发现的那样。有必要把这个人物的发展所具有的全部环节都贯穿起来，也就是说，要关注这个人在其生命的最后时期所已经扬弃的各个阶段，黑格尔在他的《精神现象学》中已经指出，这样一种必要性是与自我意识的基本运动相一致的。	<br><br>
 因此，我们想要自为地反思处于其时代中、处于历史中的科耶夫，他与那些与之交游的人一道穿越了这段历史，这些人中的每一个都是“时代之子”……这说明了我们所要触及的人物形象的多样性，尽管他们有时处在科耶夫的个人生活的边缘。在我们的叙述中还会插入一些更加自由的插曲以打断单一的分析，其中的某些插曲看来是无关紧要的离题话，或者是“众所周知的”历史事实。但这些环节本身也服从于我们的著作的内在逻辑。边缘性的“环中之环”的逻辑。我们认为，在下面这段标准的黑格尔式的话语中，科耶夫就描述了这种逻辑：	<br><br>
“让我们考虑(比如说)一棵所谓的‘具体的’树，它从我的窗边伸展过来。如果这棵树是‘殊别的’，它就与所有不属于它的东西区别开来。因此，它应该明确地与世界的其余一切分离开来。这样，当我们把它作为一个‘殊别的’和‘具体的’事物来谈论时，我们可以‘从思想上’把它孤立出来。但我们试着实际地来孤立它一下。从目前的技术水平来看，这是完全不可能的。事实上，如何把树从土壤中拔离出来而又使它毫毛无损？即使我们能够成功地做到这一点，又如何除去粘附于它的根系中的土壤和附积在它的树干和树叶上的尘埃，更不要说那已经被渗透进树木中但又尚未被吸纳的空气了。假定我们成功地做到了这一切(尽管这是不可能的)，最后会怎么样呢？我们的树立刻就死了，而且很快就会解体腐烂，也就是说，它不再是一棵树了。一棵‘殊别的’树，也就是孤立于所有非它之物的树，因此既不是‘实在的’，也不是‘具体的’：它是某种‘抽象’的产物，而且事实上是不可实现的。即使我们能真正地把它从世界的其余一切中‘抽象’出来，我们也就毁灭了这棵从这世界中催生出来的树。就这棵实存的树而言，它是与不属于它的一切相关联的。”	<br><br>
最后，我们确实只能把那些单独注明的引文和参考看作是科耶夫本人思想的代表。但这并不妨碍我们对一些文本甚至是最简短的文本提出解释，并对之做一种贴近字面的解释学的疏解。科耶夫在他于1958年所写的“字里行间的解读艺术”中不是要求他的读者这样做吗？ 	<br><br>
后记	<br><br>
本书的翻译源于我的朋友、同济大学中文系的张生教授推荐，在此先致谢意。	<br><br>
 接手之后，因杂事纷扰，兼之生性疏懒，译事久经拖延，负责本书的编辑也先后数易其人。我与三辉图书的诸位编辑均未谋面，仅通过邮件和电话联系，但衷心感谢他们给予我的耐心等待和不懈支持；尤其在最后的校读过程中，仍指出了译文中存在的许多细小问题，其认真细致的工作态度令译者感佩不已。	<br><br>
 本书的绝大部分内容主要是在2011年3月至9月间完成，尤其是7、8月的暑假期间。当时刚好迁居于华东师范大学闵行校区附近的一间租屋中，没有网络、电视的诱惑，遂使译事得以快速顺利地进行。但也因此，译者无法对书中一些不太为人熟悉的人物、事件添加更多注释。	<br><br>
 涉及科耶夫本人的著作时，译者尽可能参考了国内已有的译著(《黑格尔导读》，姜志辉译，译林出版社，2005年；《科耶夫的新拉丁帝国》，邱立波编译，华夏出版社，2008年；《法权现象学纲要》，邱立波译，华东师范大学出版社，2011年；等等)，在此也对这些译者的辛勤劳动表示感谢。	<br><br>
 作为传记，本书涉及哲学、历史、政治、经济、科学等许多方面的内容，译者受学养所限，虽勉力查找相关资料，但错谬之处肯定不少，亦请读者批评指正。	<br><br>

接手之后，因杂事纷扰，兼之生性疏懒，译事久经拖延，负责本书的编辑也先后数易其人	<br><br>
姜志辉，男，1955年生，复旦大学社会发展与公共政策学院心理学系的副教授。著名的争议译者，因其从法语、英语翻译出的大量的政治、哲学、心理学学术著作中的译文错误而受到部分读者的批评。	<br><br>
10年翻译生涯，姜志辉出了20多本书，平均速度是每年两本。“如果是大部头的书，要花一两年，薄一些的书翻半年的也有。平均下来是一年两本。”	<br><br>
在2003年以前，姜志辉在翻译时主要靠手写，用的时间比现在长，如商务印书馆出的《知觉现象学》，是2002年用了将近一年半时间翻译的。	<br><br>
2003年，姜志辉翻译《创造进化论》，开始用电脑操作，速度就加快了。这本书用了不到一年时间翻译完了。而2006年的《精神生活》，长达两卷本的篇幅，只用了8个月。	<br><br>
值得注意的是，目前在网上备受非议、且被网友一一指摘错误的两本书，也正是姜志辉开始用电脑之后的《创造进化论》和《精神生活》。	<br><br>
除了法语是专业学过的以外，他说英语、德语、拉丁语、希腊语自己都“知道一些”，“翻译这么多书没有请教过任何人，全凭一己之力。”	<br><br>
52岁的姜志辉，是复旦大学社会发展与公共政策学院心理学系的副教授，每周都要给复旦学生上课。心理学是姜志辉的主业，他说自己从事翻译，只是业余爱好。不过他认为自己是有哲学底子的，“没有底子的话，我不会出那么多译作，出版社难道都是傻瓜吗？”	<br><br>
实际上，姜志辉翻译的领域相当宽，在他迄今翻译的20多本书中，一半是哲学书，另一半既包括心理学，还包括历史、医学等方面。	<br><br>
在满洲里（Mandchourie）	<br><br>
在满洲里（Mandchourie），战争爆发了。在俄军驻扎的穆克顿（Moukden）周围，交战尤其激烈，沙俄军队出人意料地遭遇了溃败。科耶夫的父亲在身负重伤之际还参加了战斗。他的朋友列姆库尔，跟他一样是个炮兵军官，最终成功地把他从战场上撤离下来，并送到战地医院。 	<br><br>
在卡赞“战事”七八个月之后，亚历山大 科耶弗尼科夫的父亲于1905年3月在妻子的怀中死去了。从没远离过他的亚历山德拉 米特洛凡诺芙娜将独自返回莫斯科，幸有列姆库尔相伴，这种痛苦才得以缓解。米特洛凡诺芙娜性格坚强，又热情如火，她曾想过以她的方式投入到战争中去。当她回到莫斯科时，一点也没有那种牺牲者和失败者的感觉。 	<br><br>
小亚历山大什么时候才明白他父亲已死了呢？我们不得而知。科耶夫没有保留对他父亲的任何回忆。但很有可能，这一“历史性”的死亡将在科耶夫的心灵中产生回响（即使是无意识的），这使他很早就对战争（尤其是重大的历史性战争）的意义充满兴趣。 	<br><br>

Alexandre Kojève quotes	<br><br>
“Human life is a comedy-one must play it seriously.” 	<br><br>
D Alexandre Kojève 	<br><br>
“The man who works recognizes his own product in the world that has actually been transformed by his work. He recognizes himself in it, he sees his own human reality in it he discovers and reveals to others the objective reality of his humanity of the originally abstract and purely subjective idea he has of himself” 	<br><br>
D Alexandre Kojève 	<br><br>
“According to Hegel -- to use the Marxist terminology -- Religion is only an ideological superstructure that is born and exists solely in relation to a real substructure. This substructure, which supports both religion and philosophy, is nothing but the totality of human actions realized during the course of universal history, that history in and by which man has created a series of specifically human worlds, essentially different from the natural world. It is these social worlds that are reflected in the religious and philosophical ideologies, and therefore-- to come to the point at once -- absolute knowledge, which reveals the totality of Being can be realized only at the end of history, in the last world created by man.” 	<br><br>
D Alexandre Kojève, Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit  	<br><br>
“Indeed, we all know that the man who attentively contemplates a thing, who wants to see it as it is without changing anything, is 'absorbed,' so to speak, by this contemplation -- i.e., by this thing. He forgets himself, he thinks only about the thing being contemplates; he thinks neither about his contemplation, nor -- and even less -- about himself, his "I," his Selbst. The more he is conscious of the thing, the less he is conscious of himself. He may perhaps talk about the thing, but he will never talk about himself; in his discourse, the word 'I' will not occur.	<br><br>
For this word to appear, something other than purely passive contemplation, which only reveals Being, must also be present. And this other thing, according to Hegel, is Desire, Begierde....” 	<br><br>
D Alexandre Kojève, Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit  	<br><br>
“Man must be an emptiness, a nothingness, which is not a pure nothingness (reines Nichts), but something that is to the extent that it annihilates Being, in order to realize itself at the expense of Being and to nihilate in being. Man is negating Action, which transforms given Being and, by transforming it, transforms itself. Man is what he is only to the extent that he becomes what he is; his true Being (Sein) is Becoming (Werden), Time, History; and he becomes, he is History only in and by Action that negates the given, the Action of Fighting and of Work ― of the Work that finally produces the table on which Hegel writes his Phenomenology, and of the Fight that is finally that Battle at Jena whose sounds he hearts while writing the Phenomenology. And that is why, in answering the “What am I?” Hegel had to take account of both that table and those sounds.” 	<br><br>

The Dialectic of the Real and	<br><br>
the Phenomenological Method in Hegel	<br><br>
What is Dialectic, according to Hegel?	<br><br>
We can give a first answer to this question by recalling a passage from the Encyclopaedia ― more exactly, the Introduction to the First Part of the Encyclopaedia, entitled Logic.	<br><br>
In + 79 (third edition) Hegel says this:	<br><br>
With regard to its form, logic has three aspects (Seiten): (a) the abstract or understandable (versandige) aspect; (b) the dialectical or Negatively rational (vernUntige) aspect, (c) the speculative or positively rational aspect. 	<br><br>
This well-known text lends itself to two misunderstandings. On the one hand, one might believe that Dialectic reduces to the second aspect of “Logic,” isolated from the other two. But in the explanatory Note, Hegel underlines that the three aspects are in reality inseparable. And we know from elsewhere that the simultaneous presence of the three aspects in question is what gives “Logic” its dialectical character in the broad sense. But it must be noted right away that “Logic” is dialectical (in the broad sense) only because it implies a "negative” or negating aspect, which is called “dialectical” in the narrow sense. Nevertheless, dialectical “logic” necessarily implies three complementary and inseparable aspects: the “abstract” aspect (revealed by Understanding, Verstand); the “negative,” properly “dialectical,” aspect ― and the positive” aspect (the last two aspects are revealed by Reason, Vernunft).	<br><br>
On the other hand, one might suppose that Dialectic is the preserve of logical thought; or in other words, that this passage is concerned with a philosophical method, a way of investigation or exposition. Now, in fact, this is not at all the case. For Hegel’s Logic is not a logic in the common sense of the word, nor a gnoseology, but an ontology or Science of Being, taken as Being. And “the Logic” (das Logische) of the passage we have cited does not mean logical thought considered in itself, but Being (Sein) revealed (correctly) in and by thought or speech (Logos). Therefore, the three “aspects” in question are above all aspects of Being itself: they are ontological, and not logical or gnoseological, categories; and they are certainly not simple artifices of method of investigation or exposition. Hegel takes care, moreover, to underline this in the Note that follows the passage cited.	<br><br>
In this Note, he says the following: (Volume V, page 104, lines 31-33):	<br><br>
These three aspects do not constitute three parts of Logic, but are constituent-elements (Momente) of every logical-real-entity (Logisch-Reellen), that is, of every concept or of everything that is true (jedes Wahren) in general. 	<br><br>
Everything that is true, the true entity, the True, das Wahre, is a real entity, or Being itself, as revealed correctly and completely by coherent discourse having a meaning (Logos). And this is what Hegel also calls Begriff, concept; a term that means for him (except when, as in the writings of his youth and still occasionally in the Phenomenology, he says: nur Begriff) not an “abstract notion” detached from the real entity to which it is related, but “conceptually understood reality.” The True and the Concept are, as Hegel himself says, a Logisch-Reelles, something logical and real at the same time, a realised concept or a conceived reality. Now, "logical” thought that is supposed to be true, the concept that is supposed to be adequate, merely reveal or describe Being as it is or as it exists, without adding anything to it, without taking anything away from it, without modifying it in any way whatsoever. The structure of thought, therefore, is determined by the structure of the Being that it reveals. If, then, “logical” thought has three aspects, if in other words it is dialectical (in the broad sense), this is only because Being itself is dialectical (in the broad sense), because of the fact that it implies a “constituent-element” or an “aspect” that is negative or negating (“dialectical” in the narrow and strong sense of the term). Thought is dialectical only to the extent that it correctly reveals the dialectic of Being that is and of the Real that exists.	<br><br>
To be sure, pure and simple Being (Sein) does not have a threefold or dialectical structure; but the Logical ― real, the Concept or the True ― i.e., Being revealed by Speech or Thought ― does. Hence one might be inclined to say that Being is dialectical only to the extent that it is revealed by Thought, that Thought is what gives Being its dialectical character. But this formulation would be incorrect, or at least misleading. For in some sense the reverse is true for Hegel: Being can be revealed by Thought; there is a Thought in Being and of Being, only because Being is dialectical; i.e., because Being implies a negative or negating constituent element. The real dialectic of existing Being is, among other things, the revelation of the Real and of Being by Speech or Thought. And Speech and Thought themselves are dialectical only because, and to the extent that, they reveal or describe the dialectic of Being and of the Real.	<br><br>
However that may be, philosophic thought or “scientific” thought in the Hegelian sense of the word ― i.e., rigorously true thought ― has the goal of revealing, through the meaning of a coherent discourse (Logos), Being (Sein) as it is and exists in the totality of its objective-Reality (Wirklichkeit). The philosophic or “scientific” Method, therefore, must assure the adequation of Thought to Being, since Thought must adapt itself to Being and to the Real without modifying them in any way whatsoever. This is to say that the attitude of the philosopher or the "scientist” (= the Wise Man) with respect to Being and to the Real is one of purely passive contemplation, and that philosophic or “scientific” activity reduces to a pure and simple description of the Real and of Being. The Hegelian method, therefore, is not at all “dialectical": it is purely contemplative and descriptive, or better, phenomenological in Husserl’s sense of the term. In the Preface and the Introduction to the Phenomenology, Hegel insists at length on the passive, contemplative, and descriptive character of the “scientific” method. He underlines that there is a dialectic of “scientific” thought only because there is a dialectic of the Being which that thought reveals. As soon as the revealing description is correct, it can be said that ordo et connexio idearum idem est ac ordo et connexio rerum; for the order and the connection of the real are, according to Hegel, dialectical.	<br><br>
Here is what Hegel says, for example, in the Preface to the Phenomenology:	<br><br>
But scientific knowledge (Erkennen) demands, on the contrary, that one give himself (Ubergeben) to the life of the object (Gegenstandes) or, to say the same thing in different words, that one have before oneself and express in speech (auszusprechen) the inner necessity of this object. By thus plunging (sich vertiefend) into its object, this knowledge forgets that overview (Ubersicht) [thought to be possible from the outside] which is [in reality] only knowledge’s (Wissens) own face reflected back into itself from the content. But having plunged into the matter and progressing (fortgehend) in the [dialectical] movement of this matter, scientific knowledge comes back into itself; but not before the filling (ErfUllung) or the content [of the thought] gathers itself back into itself, simplifies itself to specific determination (Bestimmtheit), lowers itself to [being] an aspect (Seite) [merely] of an empirical-existence (Daseins) [the other aspect being thought], and transforms itself (Ubergeht) into its superior (hOhere) truth [or revealed reality]. By that very process, the simple-or-undivided Whole (Ganze) which has an overview of itself (sich Ubersehende) itself emerges from the richness [of the diversity] in which its reflection [into itself] seemed lost. 	<br><br>
"Scientific knowledge” gives itself or abandons itself without reserve, without preconceived ideas or afterthoughts, to the “life” and the “dialectical movement” of the Real. Thus, this truly true knowledge has nothing to do with the “Reflection” of pseudo-philosophy (i.e., pre-Hegelian philosophy) and of pseudo-science (Newtonian science), which reflects on the Real while placing itself outside of the Real, without one’s being able to say precisely where; Reflection which pretends to give an “overview” of the Real on the basis of a knowing Subject that calls itself autonomous or independent of the Object of knowledge; a Subject that, according to Hegel, is but an artificially isolated aspect of the known or revealed Real.

To be sure, in the end, “scientific knowledge” comes back toward itself and reveals itself to itself: its final goal is to describe itself in its nature, in its genesis, and in its development. Just like ordinary philosophic knowledge, it is a self-knowledge. But it is a complete and adequate self-knowledge ― that is, it is true in the strong sense of the word. And it is true because, even in its return toward itself, it simply follows passively the dialectical movement of its “content” which is the “object” ― that is, the Real and Being. The Real itself is what organises itself and makes itself concrete so as to become a determinate “species,” capable of being revealed by a general notion; the Real itself reveals itself through articulate knowledge and thereby becomes a known object that has the knowing subject as its necessary complement, so that ""empirical existence” is divided into beings that speak and beings that are spoken of. For real Being existing as Nature is what produces Man who reveals that Nature (and himself) by speaking of it. Real Being thus transforms itself into “truth” or into reality revealed by speech, and becomes a “higher” and “higher” truth as its discursive revelation becomes ever more adequate and complete."	<br><br>
It is by following this “dialectical movement” of the Real that Knowledge is present at its own birth and contemplates its own evolution. And thus it finally attains its end, which is the adequate and complete understanding of itself ― i.e., of the progressive revelation of the Real and of Being by Speech ― of the Real and Being which engender, in and by their “dialectical movement,” the Speech that reveals them. And it is thus that a total revelation of real Being or an entirely revealed Totality (an “undivided Whole”) is finally constituted: the coherent whole of Being realised in the real Universe, completely and perfectly described in the “overview” given by the one and unique "Science” or the “System” of the Wise Man, finally emerges from Being which at first was only a natural World formed of separate and disparate entities, an incoherent “richness' , in which there was no “reflection,)) no discursive knowledge, no articulate self-consciousness.	<br><br>
Taken separately, the Subject and the Object are abstractions that have neither “objective reality” (Wirklichkeit) nor “empirical existence” (Dasein). What exists in reality, as soon as there is a Reality of which one speaks ― and since we in fact speak of reality, there can be for us only Reality of which one speaks what exists in reality, I say, is the Subject that knows the Object, or, what is the same thing, the Object known by the Subject. This double Reality which is nonetheless one because it is equally real in each aspect, taken in its whole or as Totality, is called in Hegel “Spirit” (Geist) or (in the Logic) “absolute Idea.” Hegel also says: "absoluter Begriff” (“absolute Concept”). But the term Begriff can also be applied to a fragment of total revealed Being, to a “constituent-element” (Moment) of the Spirit or Idea (in which case the Idea can be defined as the integration of all the Concepts ― that is, of all the particular “ideas”). Taken in this sense, Begriff signifies a particular real entity or a real aspect of being, revealed by the meaning of a word ― i.e., by a “general notion"; or else, what is the same thing, Begriff is a “meaning” (“idea”) that exists empirically not only in the form of an actually thought, spoken, or written word, but also as a “thing.” If the (universal or “absolute”) “Idea” is the “Truth” or the Reality revealed by speech of the one and unique totality of what exists, a (particular) "Concept” is the “Truth” of a particular real entity taken separately, but understood as an integral element of the Totality. Or else, again, the “Concept” is a “true entity” (das Wahre) ― that is, a real entity named or revealed by the meaning of a word, which meaning relates it to all other real entities and thus inserts it in the "System” of the whole Real revealed by the entirety of “scientific” Discourse. Or else, finally, the “Concept” is the “essential reality” or the essence (Wesen) of a concrete entity ― that is, precisely the reality which corresponds, in that concrete entity, to the meaning of the word that designates or reveals it.	<br><br>
Like the Spirit or the Idea, each Concept is hence double and single at the same time; it is both “subjective” and “objective,” both real thought of a real entity and a real entity really thought. The real aspect of the Concept is called “object” (Gegenstand), “given-Being” (Sein), “entity that exists as a given-Being” (Seiendes), “In-itself” (Ansich), and so on. The aspect thought is called “knowledge” (Wissen), “act of knowing” (Erkennen), “knowledge” (Erkenntniss), “act of thinking” (Denken), and so on; and occasionally “concept” (Begriff) in the common sense (when Hegel says: nur Begriff). But these two aspects are inseparable and complementary, and it is of little importance to know which of the two must be called Wissen or Begriff (in the common sense), and which Gegenstand. What is of importance is that in the Truth-there is perfect coincidence of the Begriff and the Gegenstand, and that ― in the Truth ― Knowledge is purely passive adequation to essential-Reality. And that is why the true Scientist or the 'Wise Man must reduce his existence to simple contemplation (reines Zusehen) of the Real and of Being and of their “dialectical movement.” He looks at everything that is and verbally describes everything that he sees: therefore, he has nothing to do, for he modifies nothing, ― adds nothing, and takes nothing away.	<br><br>
This, at least, is what Hegel says in the Introduction to the Phenomenology:	<br><br>
If by concept we mean knowledge (Wissen), and by the essential reality (Wesen) or the true-entity (Wahre) we mean entity existing as a given-being (Seiende) or object (Gegenstand), it follows that verification (PrUfung) consists in seeing (zuzusehen) if the concept corresponds to the object. But if by concept we mean the essential reality of the In-itself (An-sich) of the object, and by object, on the other hand, we understand the object [taken] as object, namely, as it is for another [i.e., for the knowing Subject], it follows that verification consists in our seeing if the object corresponds to its concept. It is easily seen that both [expressions signify] the same thing. But what is essential is to keep [in mind] for the whole study (Untersuchung) that these two constituent-elements (Momente), [namely] concept and object, Being for another and Being in itself, are situated within the very knowledge that we are studying, and that consequently we do not need to bring in standards (MasssAbe) or to apply our [own] intuitions (EinfAlle) and ideas (Gedanken) during the study. By omitting these latter, we attain [the possibility] of viewing the thing as it is in and for itself. 	<br><br>
Now, any addition (Zutat) [coming] from us becomes superfluous not only in the sense (nach dieser Seite) that [the] concept and (the] object, the standard and what is to be verified, are present (vorhanden) in the Consciousness (Bewusstsein) itself [which we, as philosophers, study in the Phenomenology]; but we are also spared the effort of comparing the two and of verifying in the strict sense, so that ― since [studied] Consciousness verifies itself ― in this respect too, only pure contemplation (Zusehen) is left for us to do. 	<br><br>
When all is said and done, the “method” of the Hegelian Scientist consists in having no method or way of thinking peculiar to his Science. The naive man, the vulgar scientist, even the pre-Hegelian philosopher ― each in his way opposes himself to the Real and deforms it by opposing, his own means of action and methods of thought to it. The Wise Man, on the contrary, is fully and definitively reconciled with everything that is: he entrusts himself without reserve to Being and opens himself entirely to the Real without resisting it. His role is that of a perfectly flat and indefinitely extended mirror: he does not reflect on the Real; it is the Real that reflects itself on him, is reflected in his consciousness, and is revealed in its own dialectical structure by the discourse of the Wise who describes it without deforming it.	<br><br>
If you please, the Hegelian “method” is purely “empirical” or “positivist": Hegel looks at the Real and describes what he sees, everything that he sees, and nothing but what he sees. In other words, he has the “experience” (Erfahrung) of dialectical Being), and the Real, and thus he makes their "movement” pass into his discourse which describes them.	<br><br>
And that is what Hegel says in the Introduction to the Phenomenology:	<br><br>
This dialectical movement which Consciousness carries out (altsUbt) in (an) itself, both in terms of its knowledge and its object, to the extent that the new. [and] true object arises (entspringt) out of this movement [and appears] before Consciousness, is strictly speaking what is called experience (Erfahrung). 	<br><br>
To be sure, this experience “strictly speaking” is something quite different from the experience of vulgar science. The latter is carried out by a Subject who pretends to be independent of the Object, and it is supposed to reveal the Object which exists independently of the Subject. Now in actual fact the experience is had by a man who lives within Nature and is indissolubly bound to it, but is also opposed to it and wants to transform it: science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application. That is why scientific knowledge is never absolutely passive, nor purely contemplative and descriptive. Scientific experience perturbs the Object because of the active intervention of the Subject, who applies to the Object a method of investigation that is his own and to which nothing in the Object itself corresponds. What it reveals, therefore, is neither the Object taken independently of the Subject, nor the Subject taken independently of the Object, but only the result of the interaction of the two or, if you that interaction itself. However, scientific experience and knowledge are concerned with the Object as independent of and isolated from the Subject. Hence they do not find what they are looking for; they do not give what they promise, for they do not correctly reveal or describe what the Real is for them. Generally speaking Truth ( = revealed Reality) is the coincidence of thought or descriptive knowledge with the concrete real. Now, for vulgar science, this real is supposed to be independent of the thought which describes it. But in fact this science never attains this autonomous real, this “thing in itself” of Kant-Newton, because it incessantly perturbs it. Hence scientific thought does not attain its truth; there is no scientific truth in the strong and proper sense of the term. Scientific experience is thus only a pseudo-experience. And it cannot be otherwise, for vulgar science is in fact concerned not with the concrete real, but with an abstraction. To the extent that the scientist thinks or knows his object, what really and concretely exists is the entirety of the Object known by the Subject or of the Subject knowing the Object. The isolated Object is but an abstraction, and that is why it has no fixed and stable continuity (Bestehen) and is perpetually deformed or perturbed. Therefore it cannot serve as a basis for a Truth, which by definition is universally and eternally valid. And the same goes for the “object” of vulgar psychology, gnoseology, and philosophy, which is the Subject artificially isolated from the Object ― i.e., yet another abstraction. 	<br><br>
Hegelian experience is a different story: it reveals concrete Reality, and reveals it without modifying or “perturbing” it. That is why, when this experience is described verbally, it represents a Truth in the strong sense of the term. And that is why it has no specific method of its own, as experience, thought, or verbal description, that is not at the same time an "objective” structure of the concrete Real itself which it reveals by describing it.	<br><br>
The concrete Real (of which we speak) is both Real revealed by a discourse, and Discourse revealing a real. And the Hegelian experience is related neither to the Real nor to Discourse taken separately, but to their indissoluble unity. And since it is itself a revealing Discourse, it is itself an aspect of the concrete Real which it describes. It therefore brings in nothing from outside, and the thought or the discourse which is born from it is not a reflection on the Real: the Real itself is what reflects itself or is reflected in the discourse or as thought. In particular, if the thought and the discourse of the Hegelian Scientist or the Wise Man are dialectical, it is only because they faithfully reflect the “dialectical movement” of the Real of which they are a part and which they experience adequately by giving themselves to it without any preconceived method.	<br><br>
Hegel's method, then, is not at all dialectical, and Dialectic for him is quite different from a method of thought or exposition. And we can even say that, in a certain way, Hegel was the first to abandon Dialectic as a philosophic method. He was, at least, the first to do so voluntarily and with full knowledge of what he was doing.	<br><br>
The dialectical method was consciously and systematically used for the first time by Socrates-Plato. But in fact it is as old as philosophy itself. For the dialectical method is nothing but the method of dialogue ― that is, of discussion.	<br><br>
Everything seems to indicate that Science was born in the form of Myth. A Myth is a theory ― that is, a discursive revelation of the real. Of course, it is supposed to be in agreement with the given real. But in fact, it always goes beyond its givens, and once beyond them, it only has to be coherent ― i.e., free of internal contradictions ― in order to make a show of truth. The period of Myth is a period of monologue, and in this period one demonstrates nothing because one “discusses” nothing, since one is not yet faced with a contrary or simply different opinion. And that is precisely why there is true or false “myth” or “opinion” (doxa), but no “science” or “truth” properly so-called.	<br><br>
Then, by chance, the man who has an opinion, or who has created or adopted a myth, comes up against a different myth or a contrary opinion. This man will first try to get rid of it: either by plugging up his ears in some way, by an internal or external 94 censoring"; or by overcoming (in the non-dialectical sense of the term) the adverse myth or opinion, by putting to death or banishing its propagators, for example, or by acts of violence that will force the others to say the same thing as he (even if they do not think the same thing).	<br><br>
But it can happen (and we know that this actually did happen one day, somewhere) that the man begins to discuss with his adversary. By an act of freedom he can decide to want to “convince” him, by “refuting” him and by "demonstrating” his own Point of view. To this end he speaks with his adversary, he engages in a dialogue with him: he uses a dialectical method. And it is by becoming a dialectician that the man of myth or opinion becomes a scientist or a philosopher.	<br><br>
In Plato (and probably already in Socrates) all this became conscious. If Plato has Socrates say that not the trees, but only the men in the city can teach him something, it is because he understood that, starting from (false or true) myth and opinion, one can attain science and truth only by way of discussion ― that is, by way of dialogue or dialectic. In fine, according to Socrates-Plato, it is from the collision of diverse and adverse opinions that the spark of the one and the only truth is finally struck. A “thesis” is opposed to an “anti-thesis,” which, by the way, the thesis generally provokes. They confront each other, correct one another mutually ― that is, destroy each other ― but also combine and finally engender a “synthetic” truth. But this latter is still just one opinion among many others. It is a new thesis that will find or arouse a new anti-thesis, in order to associate itself with it by negating i.e., by modifying it ― in a new synthesis, in which it will be different from what it was at the start. And so on, until one achieves a “synthesis” that will no longer be the thesis of a discussion or a “thesis” that can be discussed; an indisputable “truth” that will no longer be a simple “opinion” or one of the possible opinions; or, speaking objectively, the single One which is not in opposition to an Other because it is the Whole ― the Idea of the ideas, or the Good.	<br><br>
In philosophy or science born from discussion ― that is, in dialectical (or synthetic) truth which realises the Good in man by verbally revealing the One ― Whole ― the intermediate theses, antitheses, and syntheses are aufgehoben, as Hegel will later say. They are “overcome,” in the threefold sense of the German word Aufheben ― that is, “overcome dialectically.” In the first place, they are overcome or annulled with respect to whatever is fragmentary relative, partial, or one-sided in them ― that is, with respect to what makes them false when one of them is taken not for an opinion, but as the truth. Secondly, they are also preserved or safeguarded with respect to whatever is essential or universal in them ― that is, with respect to what in each of them reveals one of the manifold aspects of the total and single reality. Finally, they are sublimated ― that is, raised to a superior level of knowledge and of reality, and therefore of truth, for by completing one another, the thesis and the antithesis get rid of their one-sided and limited or, better, “subjective” character, and as synthesis they reveal a more comprehensive and hence a more comprehensible aspect of the “objective” real.	<br><br>
But if dialectic finally attains the adequation of discursive thought to Reality and Being, nothing in Reality and Being corresponds to dialectic. The dialectical movement is a movement of human thought and discourse, but the reality itself which one thinks and of which one talks is in no way dialectical. Dialectic is but a method of philosophic research and exposition. And we see, by the way, that the method is dialectical only because it implies a negative or negating element: namely, the antithesis which opposes the thesis in a verbal fight and calls for an effort of demonstration, an effort, moreover, indistinguishable from a refutation. There is truth properly so-called ― that is, scientific or philosophic truth, or better, dialectical or synthetical truth ― only where there has been discussion or dialogue ― that is, antithesis negating a thesis.	<br><br>
In Plato, the dialectical method is still quite close to its historical origins (the sophistic discussions). In his writings we are dealing with genuine dialogues, in which the thesis and the antithesis are presented by different persons (Socrates generally incarnates the antithesis of all theses asserted by his interlocutors or expressed successively by one of them). And as for the synthesis, it is generally the auditor who must make it ― the auditor who is the philosopher properly so-called: Plato himself or that disciple who is capable of understanding him. This auditor finally attains the absolute truth which results from the entirety of the dialectic or from the coordinated movement of all the dialogues, a truth that reveals the “total” or “synthetical” Good which is capable of fully and definitively “satisfying” the one who knows it and who is consequently beyond discussion or dialectic.	<br><br>
In Aristotle the dialectical method is less apparent than in Plato. But it continues to be applied. It becomes the aporetic method: the solution of the problem results from a discussion (and sometimes from a simple juxtaposition) of all possible opinions ― that is, of all opinions that are coherent and do not contradict themselves. And the dialectical method was preserved in this “scholastic” form until our time in both the sciences and philosophy.	<br><br>
But along a parallel line there was something else.	<br><br>
Like all opinion, the Myth arises spontaneously and is accepted (or rejected) in the same way. Man creates it in and by his (“poetical”) imagination, content if he avoids contradictions when he develops his initial idea or “intuition.” But when the confrontation with a different opinion or myth engenders the desire for a proof, which cannot as yet be satisfied by a demonstration through discussion, one feels the need to found one's opinion or the myth that one is proposing (both being supposed to be unverifiable empirically ― i.e., by an appeal to common sense experience) on something more than simple personal conviction or “subjective certainty” (Gewissheit) ― which is visibly of the same type and weight as the adversary’s. A foundation of superior or “divine” value is sought and found: the myth is presented as having been “revealed” by a god, who is supposed to be the guarantee for its truth ― that is, for its universal and eternal validity.	<br><br>
Just like dialectical truth, this “revealed” mythical truth could not have been found by an isolated man confronted with Nature. Here too “trees teach man nothing.” But “the men in the city” do not teach him anything either. It is a God who reveals the truth to him in a “myth.” But in contrast to dialectical truth, this mythical truth is not the result of a discussion or a dialogue: God alone spoke, while man was content to listen, to understand, and to transcribe (and to do this far from the city, on the top of a mountain, and so on).	<br><br>
Even after having been a Platonic philosopher, man can still sometimes return to the “mythological” period. Such was the case of Saint Augustine. But this "return” is in reality a “synthesis": the myth-revealing God becomes a quasi-Socratic interlocutor; man engages in dialogue with his God, even if he does not go so far as to have a discussion with him (Abraham, however, discusses with Jehovah!). But this divine-human “dialogue” is but a hybrid and transitory form of the dialectical method. Accordingly, it assumed an infinite variety of forms among the diverse “Mystics,” ranging from true dialogue in which “God” is but a title for the human interlocutor with whom one discusses, to diverse “revelations” on the tops of mountains in which the human partner is only a mute auditor, “convinced” beforehand.	<br><br>
In any case, the divine interlocutor is, in fact, fictitious. It all happens in the soul itself of the “scientist.” And that is why Saint Augustine had "dialogues” with his “soul.” And a distant disciple of that Platonic (or Plotinian) Christian, Descartes, deliberately dropped God and was content to have dialogue and discussion with himself. Thus Dialectic became “Meditation.” It was in the form of Cartesian meditation that the dialectical method was used by the authors of the great philosophical “systems” of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: from Descartes to Kant-Fichte-Schelling. At first sight, this is a step backwards in relation to Socrates-Plato-Aristotle. The great modern “Systems” are like so many “Myths” which are juxtaposed without being discussed, which are created out of nothing by their authors without coming from an earlier dialogue. But in fact, this is not at all the case. On the one hand the author himself discusses his “theses” and demonstrates their veracity by refuting possible objections or “antitheses": thus he applies a dialectical method. On the other hand, in fact, the Platonic Dialogues preceded these Systems, which come from them “dialectically” through the intermediary of the aporetic discussions of Aristotle and the scholastic Aristotelians. And just as in a Platonic Dialogue, the auditor (who in this case is a historian-philosopher of philosophy) discovers the absolute truth as the result of the implicit or tacit “discussion” between the great Systems of history, hence, as the result of their “dialectic."	<br><br>
Hegel was the first of these auditor-historian-philosophers. In any case, he was the first to be so consciously. And that is why he was the first who could knowingly abandon Dialectic conceived as a philosophical method. He is content to observe and describe the dialectic which was effected throughout history, and he no longer needs to make a dialectic himself. This dialectic, or the “dialogue” of the Philosophies, took place before him. He only has to have the “experience” of it and to describe its synthetical final result in a coherent discourse: the expression of the absolute truth is nothing but the adequate verbal description of the dialectic which engendered it. Thus, Hegel's Science is “dialectical” only to the extent that the Philosophy which prepared it throughout History has been (implicitly or explicitly) dialectical.	<br><br>
At first sight, this attitude of Hegel is a simple return to Plato. If Plato lets Parmenides, Protagoras, Socrates, and still others have dialogues, while being content to record the result of their discussions, Hegel records the result of the discussion which he organises between Plato and Descartes, Spinoza and Kant, Fichte and Schelling, and so on. Hence, here again we would seem to be dealing with a dialectical method in the search for truth or in its exposition, which in no way affects the Real which that truth reveals. And Hegel does actually say somewhere that he is only rediscovering the ancient or, rather, Platonic, dialectic. But a closer examination shows that this is not at all the case, and that when Hegel speaks of Dialectic, he is talking about something quite different from what is found in his predecessors.'	<br><br>
One can say, if one pleases, that the eternal light of absolute Hegelian truth, too, comes from the collision of all the philosophic opinions which preceded it. However, this ideal dialectic, the dialogue of the Philosophies, took place, according to Hegel, only because it is a reflection of the real dialectic of Being. And only because it reflects this real dialectic does it finally achieve, in the person of Hegel, the truth or the complete and adequate revelation of the Real. Each philosophy correctly reveals or describes a turning point or a stopping place ― thetical, antithetical, or synthetical ― of the real dialectic, of the Bewegung of existing Being. And that is why each philosophy is “true” in a certain sense. But it is true only relatively or temporarily: it remains “true” as long as a new philosophy, also “true,” does not come along to demonstrate its “error.” However, a philosophy does not by itself transform itself into another philosophy or engender that other philosophy in and by an autonomous dialectical movement. The Real corresponding to a given philosophy itself becomes really other (thetical, antithetical, or synthetical), and this other Real is what engenders another adequate philosophy, which, as “true,” replaces the first philosophy which has become “false.” Thus, the dialectical movement of the history of philosophy, which ends in the absolute or definitive truth, is but a reflection, a “superstructure,” of the dialectical movement of the real history of the Real. And that is why all philosophy that is “true” is also essentially “false": it is false in so far as it presents itself not as the reflection or description of a constituent element or a dialectical “moment” of the real, but as the revelation of the Real in its totality. Nonetheless, even while being or becoming “false,” all philosophy (worthy of the name) remains “true,” for the total Real implies and will always imply the aspect (or the “moment”) which that philosophy revealed. The absolute truth or the Science of the Wise Man, of Hegel that is, the adequate and complete revelation of the Real in its Totality ― is indeed, therefore, an integral synthesis of all the philosophies presented throughout history. However, neither these philosophies through their discussions, nor the historian-philosopher who observes them, effects the synthesis in question: real History is what does it, at the end of its own dialectical movement; and Hegel is content to record it without having to do anything whatsoever, and consequently, without resorting to a specific mode of operation or a method of his own.	<br><br>
“Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht” (“World History is a tribunal that judges the World”). History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions, and lastly their philosophical opinions as well. To be sure, History is, if you please, a long “discussion” between men. But this real historical “discussion” is something quite different from a philosophic dialogue or discussion. The “discussion” is carried out not with verbal arguments, but with clubs and swords or cannon on the one hand, and with sickles and hammers or machines on the other. If one wants to speak of a "dialectical method” used by History, one must make clear that one is talking about methods of war and of work. This real, or better, active, historical dialectic is what is reflected in the history of philosophy. And if Hegelian Science is dialectical or synthetical, it is only because it describes that real dialectic in its totality, as well as the series of consecutive philosophies which corresponds to that dialectical reality. Now, by the way, reality is dialectical only because it implies a negative or negating element: namely, the active negation of the given, the negation which is at the foundation of every bloody fight and of all so-called “physical” work.	<br><br>
Hegel does not need a God who would reveal the truth to him. And to find the truth, he does not need to hold dialogues with “the men in the city,” or even to have a “discussion” with himself or to “meditate” a' la Descartes. (Besides, no purely verbal discussion, no solitary meditation, can lead to the truth, of which Fighting and Work are the only “criteria.”) He can find it all alone, while sitting tranquilly in the shade of those “trees” which taught Socrates nothing, but which teach Hegel many things about themselves and about men. But all this is possible only because there have been cities in which men had discussions against a background of fighting and work, while they worked and fought for and because of their opinions (cities, moreover, which were surrounded by these same trees whose wood was used in their construction). Hegel no longer discusses because he benefits from the discussion of those who preceded him. And if, having nothing more to do, he has no method of his own, it is because he profits from all the actions effected throughout history. His thought simply reflects the Real. But he can do so only because the Real is dialectical ― that is, imbued with the negating action of fighting and work, which engenders thought and discourse, causes them to move, and finally realises their perfect coincidence with the Real which they are supposed to reveal or to describe. In short, Hegel does not need a dialectical method because the truth which he incarnates is the final result of the real or active dialectic of universal History, which his thought is content to reproduce through his discourse.	<br><br>
From Socrates-Plato until Hegel, Dialectic was only a philosophical method without a counterpart in the real. In Hegel there is a real Dialectic, but the philosophical method is that of a pure and simple description, which is dialectical only in the sense that it describes a dialectic of reality.	<br><br>

Abstract:       	<br><br>
Alexandre Kojeve has been a mirage of continental philosophic thought. He has been said to have been a major influence on nearly all of French postmodern thought, to have had a significant impact on the formation of Europe as a bureaucrat and to have dominated French foreign policy in the post-war period. This paper tries to separate myth from fact and to introduce to Kojeve's Hegelian philosophy.	<br><br>
Dr Christoph Kletzer is a Senior Lecturer in Legal Philosophy. He joined King's in 2007 having previously been a Lecturer at the University of Cambridge (2005-2007) and before that at the University of Durham (2004-2005). Dr Kletzer has also been the Director of Studies in Philosophy at Queens College in Cambridge and has been lecturing at the Philosophy Department of the University of Vienna for the last two years. He graduated with a MA in Law and a MA in Philosophy from the University of Vienna. After that he obtained a LLM and PhD from the University Cambridge	<br><br>

苏秦和张仪哪个更牛？	<br><br>
 Kojève苏秦张仪鬼谷子纵横捭阖，简单看看黄易的《寻秦记》就得。	<br><br>
苏秦和张仪都是战国晚期有名的的纵横家或策士，用现在的话说，二人都是国际社会著名的政治家、外交家和社会活动家，用老百姓的话说就是靠耍嘴皮子吃饭的人。然而，就是这两个文弱书生，以其超人的智慧和诡谲的计谋，凭着三寸不烂之舌，穿梭于国际社会之中，把世界各国玩弄于股掌之上，弄得国际社会风云变幻，惊涛骇浪。他们的纵横捭阖，深刻影响着战国后期群雄之间间并战争的形势，其观点和思想对后世王朝也产生了深远的影响。孟老夫子的学生景春大呼说：苏、张“一怒而天下惧，安居则天下熄”。	<br><br>
苏秦，字季子，洛阳东郊人，大约生活在公元前三一七至二七五年之间，是战国末期著名的纵横家。苏秦出身农民，自幼家境贫寒，但他素有大志，曾师从鬼谷子教授演习纵横捭阖之术多年，然而出道后却处处碰壁，仕途艰难，后来不得不回到家中继续苦读数年。再次出道后，得到燕昭王信任拜为上卿，为报燕王知遇之恩，就到齐国做官而暗中为燕国效力，他为削弱齐国力量达到不能犯燕的目的，多次向齐王出馊主义，弄得齐国四面树敌，一度灭国。后游说赵、韩、魏、燕、齐、宋六国“合纵”抗秦，他亲自任“纵约长”，一人佩戴六国相印，成了当时名负其实的联合国秘书长，其权力更是现代意义上的秘书长不能望其相背的。被后人称为“合纵之父”。	<br><br>
张仪年龄比苏秦稍长，但出道比苏秦要晚。生卒年不详，大约生活在公元前三六O至三一0年间。据说出身魏国名门之后，和苏秦同为鬼谷子教授的学生（这位鬼先生看来也是一位大牛人，他是中国第一所军校的校长兼教授，出自他门下的学生除了苏秦和张仪外，还有孙膑和庞涓呢！此是后话，不提。），张仪按岁数是苏秦的老哥和学长，他的仕宦之路不象苏秦那样砍坷，总体上还算比较顺畅的。由于苏秦出道较早，为官在前，他就找到小学弟帮忙给自己弄个一官半职，因受到苏秦的冷遇怒而向秦，得到秦王信任拜其为丞相，居百官之首，成为秦庭的二号人物，权倾朝野。随后，他赌着一口气，专门和苏秦对着干，你不是“合纵”吗？我就“连横”，分划瓦解苏秦倡导和组织的“合纵”阵营，并终于如愿以偿。张仪的连横策略为秦国的东进和崛起产生了积极的推动作用，为秦的最终统一奠定了基础。被后人称为“连横之父”。	<br><br>
史书记载和后世之人均把二人相提并论。这是有一定道理的。从出道之前看，二人均是一介寒儒，苏秦更是穷得连饭都吃不上，第一次失败回家，连穷嫂子都看不起他，不给他饭吃，苏秦只好有一顿没一顿地硬撑着，没日没夜地“头悬梁、锥刺骨”地苦读兵书；张仪虽说是名门之后，也不过是个破落户弟子，不然就不会跑到深山老林去和鬼先生学习捭阖之术了。但比苏秦还是要强一些，至少还没有衣食之虞。从权力拥有程度上看，苏秦似乎又比张仪稍强，除了出道较早外，张先生还啥都不是的时候，人家苏秦就是身炝国相印之人了，六国军政大事V决于苏秦一人，就连虎狼之国秦国因为有苏秦当权，十五年竟不敢出函谷关，足见其地位和作用。即便张仪后来做了秦国国相，那也只是一国之相，怎能和用有实权的联合国秘书长相提并论呢？从实际操作上看，二人基本旗鼓相当，苏秦倡导的“合纵”不可谓不成功，但张仪主张的“连横”也卓有成效，都是凭着过人的学识和诡谲的计谋，以三寸不烂之舌把各国君王鼓噪得头大，大事小事悉听尊便。从运作的结果上看，张仪有过苏秦之处，虽然苏秦“合纵”在先，张仪“连横”在后，但最终还是让张仪用“连横”之术把把苏秦的“合纵'之策打破，六国终久还是被秦国各个击破，最终被彻底灭掉。从人生的结局看，张仪明显比苏秦要强得多，虽然二人最后都被罢了相，但苏秦在齐国的阴谋暴露后，被齐王“车裂”而死，而张仪只是被秦逐到魏国老故，怎么说也算得到了善终。	<br><br>
从以上四个方面的考查情况看，二人各有优劣，旗鼓相当。	<br><br>
但值得注意的是，无论是苏秦的“合纵”抗秦还是张仪的'连横”助秦，这一切均出自苏秦的自导自演。张仪的所作所为不过是苏秦一盘棋上的一个“棋子儿”而已。	<br><br>
其实苏秦自己心里最清楚，靠一张嘴混饭吃最好就是把天下这盆水搅得越浑越好，他认为，要使自己长久地立于不败之地，必须要有势均力敌的对手，必须让各国始终感到威胁的存在。没有强秦的威胁，就不会有他卖弄“合纵”的市场，如果秦国因惧怕六国联合抗秦而始终不敢轻举妄动，时间一久，“合纵”也就失去了意义，“纵约长”也就自然没有存在的必要了，这是苏秦不愿意看到的。他必须要找一个专门和自己对着干的人，鼓捣着秦国分化瓦解六国，时不时地攻打某些国家，只有这样他的六国相印才能挂结实挂长久，才能显现出他的地位、作用和价值来。就是现在也是一样，如果没有大国之间的争斗和东西阵营的存在，美国的基辛格，前苏联的戈尔巴乔夫的演讲也就不会值那么多钱了，他们的斡旋行动也不会那么引起世界关注了。	<br><br>
其实早在张仪找苏秦“开后门儿”的时候，苏秦就设下了这个计谋。他表面上对张仪不盐不淡，冷冷清清，甚至从礼节上怠慢张仪，用傲慢的语言激怒张仪，并让张仪到秦国去试试看。实际上苏秦对这位学长的才能和性情还是很有数的，知道张仪在他这里吃了闭门}之后，一定会找机会和平台出这口恶气，如此，则这个世界一定会被弄得一刻也安定不了了。这样一来，不但自己始终有用武之地，就是张老哥也一定会因此而飞黄腾达。果然，张仪不知是计，怀着对苏秦强烈的不满，骂骂咧咧地离开苏秦前往秦国去了。	<br><br>
事实正如苏秦预料的那样，张仪到秦国后，化愤怒为动力，为秦王竭尽忠智，以希用秦国之力，扫平六国，让苏秦知道他张仪也不是吃素的。为了打破“合纵”，他惮惊竭虑，穿梭于各国之间，目的只有一个，你苏秦不是看不起我张仪吗？今儿老子就让你瞧睢是你苏秦有本事还是我张仪有能耐！你不是“合纵”吗？我坚决让你合不了也纵不成，你不是联合抗秦吗，老子坚决要一个一个地收拾你。就这样，一个七雄并立的世界在二人的操纵下，到处争战不止，到处腥风血雨。	<br><br>
虽然张仪最后基本上达到了目的，然而，张仪到死也不会知道，这只不过是他的学弟使的一个激将法而已，就连他当初到秦国谋生的盘缠钱还是苏秦给他的呢，只是苏秦并没有让张仪知道罢了。张仪有知，岂不愧煞老脸呼？	<br><br>
由此来看，他们两个最牛的还是苏秦。但以我们现在的观点来看，虽然他们的主张客观上加速了历史的进程，但终久他们在主观上是为了自己的仕途和权力，并且是以千万人的流血牺牲作赌注和代价的，从人格上看，他们两个谁也不值得牛！	<br><br>

海洋局高度评价雪龙号南极救人 称树立国家形象	<br><br>
 新京报 2014-01-04 03	<br><br>
2013年11月7日，中国第30次南极考察队乘坐“雪龙”号极地科考船从中国极地科考码头启航，开始其第30次南极之行。此次南极科考是“雪龙”号首次环南极航行任务，将执行30项科学考察任务，15项后勤保障及工程建设项目，其重中之重便是在伊利莎白公主地新建中国第四个南极科考站--中国南极泰山站。泰山站为夏季站，位于中山站和昆仑站之间，海拔2621米，今后不仅是昆仑站科学考察的前沿支撑，还将成为格罗夫山地区南极科考的重要平台，进一步拓展中国南极科考的领域和范围。	<br><br>
据新华社电 成功完成俄罗斯船52名被困人员的援救行动后，“雪龙”号3日在撤离自身所处的这片密集浮冰区时却被冰山“强行挽留”。	<br><br>
记者看到，一夜之间“雪龙”号右侧密集的浮冰区里，不知何时漂来了一座平顶大冰山，冰山长达一公里左右，还在不断向西北方向漂移，最近时与“雪龙”号相距仅1.2海里（1海里等于1.852公里），横亘在“雪龙”号撤离路线前方。	<br><br>
“雪龙”号船长王建忠说，这片海域正值天文大潮，海水涨潮和落潮的规律极其特殊复杂。涨潮期间，海冰整体随海水升高2米多，落潮时间很快，冰山与浮冰随着海水剧烈变化。目前，只能等待前方的大冰山漂走，再从密集的浮冰区里破冰突围。	<br><br>
南大洋漂浮的冰山由南极大陆的降雪挤压而成。这种降雪经过长年累月的挤压，逐渐推移到冰川或冰盖末端，进而断裂分离、漂进大海、形成冰山。一座座冰山看上去虽然很美，却是船舶航行的大敌。露出海面的冰山仅为“冰山一角”，海水下面的冰山至少还有6倍大。	<br><br>
救援行动树立国家形象	<br><br>
国家海洋局局长刘赐贵3日通过卫星视频会议系统，高度评价了中国第30次南极科学考察队在极端艰苦、极其复杂的环境中，成功救援俄罗斯船被困人员的行动。他认为这次行动树立了中国作为极地考察大国和负责任国家的形象。	<br><br>
刘赐贵指示考察队全体队员群策群力，等待合适的天气、时机破冰突围。	<br><br>
目前，国家海洋环境预报中心已进入一级备战状态，随时给“雪龙”号提供最新的冰情信息，考察队也成立了环境资料分析组，组织船上海冰专家随时监测冰山动向，观察气象、水文、潮汐等数据，并且多方收集资料，分析这片海域历年来的情况，争取早日破冰突围。	<br><br>
“雪龙”号救援行动难以置信	<br><br>
据新华社电 南极时间2014年1月2日晚，“雪龙”号科考船“雪鹰12”直升机成功将俄罗斯“绍卡利斯基院士”号上的52名被困人员援救到澳大利亚“南极光”号上。	<br><br>
在“雪龙”号驾驶台的甚高频里，先后传来“绍卡利斯基院士”号和“南极光”号的感谢声――“感谢‘雪龙’号！”“我们完成了让人难以置信的救援！”	<br><br>
“绍卡利斯基院士”船上的许多被困人员也表达了对“雪龙”号的感激之情。来自新西兰的科学家科林对记者说：“过去几天，大家看到‘雪龙’号来了都非常兴奋。尤其是看到‘雪龙’号要冲破那么厚的海冰才能赶来，我们都非常感激。”	<br><br>
在所有乘客都被救出后，“绍卡利斯基院士”号船长立即给“雪龙”号船长发来热情洋溢的电子邮件。他说：“你们的努力是国际合作的典范，不仅体现了人类航海中的互助精神，也体现了《南极条约》精神。”	<br><br>
“雪龙”号（英文名：Xue Long），中国第三代极地破冰船和科学考察船，是由乌克兰赫尔松船厂在1993年3月25日完成建造的一艘维他斯 白令级破冰船。中国于1993年从乌克兰进口，以1750万美元低价购得，然后船厂按照中国的需求进行改造。	<br><br>
“雪龙”号是中国最大的极地考察船，也是中国唯一能在极地破冰前行的船只。雪龙船耐寒，能以1.5节航速连续冲破1.2米厚的冰层（含0.2米雪），是中国进行极区科学考察的唯一的一艘功能齐全的破冰船。	<br><br>
1994年10月首次执行南极科考和物资补给运输，“雪龙”号已先后11次赴南极，至2012年已5次赴北极执行科学考察与补给运输任务，足迹遍布五大洋，创下了中国航海史上多项新纪录。	<br><br>
俄罗斯“绍卡利斯基院士”号科学考察船，1982年由芬兰为前苏联建造，起初用于海洋研究。1998年经改造后，“绍卡利斯基院士号”开始极地研究工作，属俄罗斯远东水文气象研究所。2011年曾从俄罗斯出发到达了东南极洲。	<br><br>
俄“绍卡利斯基院士”号是一艘“冰间航行级”旅游船，在其科考生涯中，该船一直在太平洋海域航行，从未到达过南极或北极，现归俄远东水文气象科研所，但由澳大利亚运营机构使用。此次该船载有74名乘客，包括一支澳大利亚科考队以及来自英国、阿根廷、荷兰、新西兰、智利等国游客。	<br><br>
2013年12月25日在南极洲航行时被浮冰所困。受恶劣天气、能见度差等问题影响，中国破冰船“雪龙”号和澳大利亚破冰船“南极光”号30日救援被困南极冰面的俄罗斯游船“绍卡利斯基院士”号计划受阻，救援行动被迫停止。早前，法国破冰船“星盘”号也因性能不佳停止救援行动。俄外交部30日表示，如果天气条件允许，将用中国“雪龙”号上的直升机撤离被困船只上的人员。	<br><br>
2013年12月25日6时许，从“中山站”起航不久正前往罗斯海的“雪龙”号收到了来自俄罗斯“绍卡利斯基院士”号的求救信号并随即前往救援，“那是一艘计划重走百年前斯科特登陆南极的航线的水文气象调查船，不具备破冰能力。”王建中介绍道。	<br><br>
据王建中回忆，当“雪龙”号于29日到达“绍卡利斯基院士”号遇险现场外围浮冰区时，因暴风雪而“伸手不见五指，能见度还不到20米！”而在恶劣的天气屡屡阻拦救援的同时，“绍卡利斯基院士”号已因冰层挤压而几乎悬空，船体还出现了裂缝，“船的两头还有两个大冰山向它挤压，随时可能船毁人亡。”	<br><br>
虽然救援工作未能顺利进行，但“雪龙”号却原地坚守，不曾离开。“看到网上有人说我们是在逞能，但是我们没有选择，因为生命是无价的，我们应该给他们一个希望”，王建中说。	<br><br>
1月2日，随着天气的转晴，“绍卡利斯基院士”号上52名被困乘客均被安全转移。但就在同一天的晚些时候，“雪龙”号自身却因突如其来的恶劣天气被困，经v数天等待之后，最终一块横亘在船头的大浮冰突然开裂，开出一条水路。	<br><br>
王建中告诉记者，在无数封来自“绍卡利斯基院士”号乘客发来的感谢邮件中，他印象很深的是有人说，“我们从没见过面，但是当我们生命遇到威胁时，你们将我们从逆境中救出来，最感动的是，我们离开了，你们还在冰区。”	<br><br>

多中心化的权力结构是西欧封建得天独厚的遗产，而非自我束缚的愚蠢造物	<br><br>
刘仲敬   文 武汉大学历史学院博士生 	<br><br>
华夏文明位于人类文明的边缘地带，年龄相较两希文明远为单薄。晚清士大夫为了保护误置的虚荣，试图将古典华夏描绘成与古典诸文明平起平坐的一员，因此给诸夏设置了有失公正的苛刻标准。但我们细加梳理，就会承认商周没有犹太-基督教和罗马法的深厚沉淀，宗法礼制也不可能是普通法的种子。西欧封建是人类最古老、最丰富文明的嫡系继承者，多中心化的权力结构是它得天独厚的遗产，而非自我束缚的愚蠢造物。西欧式封建蕴含了司法国的前景，华夏宗法封建的未来却是德化国和东方专制，两条历史路径在起点或许相去不远，在终点已经南辕北辙。	<br><br>
周礼社会的贵族训练包括庠、序、辟雍、泮宫多种名目。战国以后的儒家解释说：庠是国人的乡校，序是土著的乡校，辟雍是射、御的竞技场，泮宫是乐、舞的会所。祭祀、武士和社交的内涵融为一体，人格和举止互为表里。他们通常会主持家族、封地的祭祀，组织同侪的民社。三者都有柔性规训小共同体的意味，然而没有任何证据表明：礼制具有类似西欧的“司法国”功能。毕竟，礼乐的教育意义多于法律意义。礼乐教人怎样适应社会角色，造就优秀的仲裁者，但自身并不构成仲裁的具体依据。春秋时期的成文法产生以前，各地肯定存在会有习俗或惯例以应对仲裁需要；但周人的阶级复杂性较低，没有分化出法学利益攸关集团。从演化模式的角度考虑，没有利益集团守护的演化路径最有可能废弃。相反，礼乐产生了强大的教育利益集团。儒家和这种集团形成了演化意义上的共生关系，挤占了习惯法利益集团一度似乎有可能占据的生态位和演化路径。	<br><br>
周礼社会的仲裁位于德教和甲兵之间，均以德性-巫术思维为基础。真正意义上的法律是契约的后继，产生于确定的因果关系。交感巫术依靠相关性模拟，对因果极为陌生。周礼的仲裁需要以下条件，才能达到最佳效果：礼乐发挥精神熏陶和指导作用，允许仲裁者在具体情况下的自由裁量权；基于德教巫术的仲裁者艺术只能是一种依靠经验习得或传授的秘传心法，惯例的积累和细密化这种法学特征会缩小仲裁者的自由裁量权，仲裁便僵死了，这对礼乐的艺术-巫术效果有害；仲裁者应具备巫师和艺术家的特征，而非法学家的。	<br><br>
巫术思维不是周礼社会独有的特征，而是几乎所有原始社会和早期文明普遍的特征。人类相信普遍性规则或契约，其实是非常困难和违反自然的事情。几乎所有儿童都是交感巫术的信徒和语言魔法的巫师，无需任何训练。相反，理性思维才是训练的产物。甚至许多教育薄弱和意志薄弱的成年人都会经常退回到巫术思维中，面临重大压力时尤其如此。目前已知的普遍性规则或契约传统，大部分均可直接或间接地追溯到犹太人的一神教和律法传统。古代犹太人以此为认同标识，感到自己不同于多神教、巫术和人治的东方邻邦。然而，隔绝巫术思维的华夏文明几乎是一个不可想象的概念。谁能想象一种用肺呼吸的鱼类呢？这种生物如果存在，大概应该属于某种遭到误解的鲸类吧。	<br><br>
日耳曼人习惯法得以汇集和体系化，得益于多重司法权威的竞争刺激。11世纪以前，政教二元性和教廷对罗马法的改造意义重大。教会法的示范作用足够强大，垄断作用又不够强大。政出多门的封建法庭大多依靠诉讼当事方的讼费为生，有总结和改良司法程序、尽可能吸引客户的强烈动机。亨利二世的普通法改革在这方面堪称典范，但绝不是惟一的。如果说宗法封建是一座整齐有序的阶梯金字塔，西欧封建就是一座三维网络构成的迷宫。前者只要确定了亲亲关系，就能确定相互的权利义务。宗法的目的之一就是杜绝跨越层次的多重联接，保证差序的稳定性。后者肯定包括大量跨越层次和节点的联接，许多节点的权利义务不能依据血缘关系确定。多层次契约关系相互锁定、相互冲突，不断制造宪法危机。任何领主都要有所准备，为不同契约义务的优先级顺序解释权而发动战争。差序永远不稳定，封建网络会像神经元网络一样自行演化产生新的联接。联接密度跨越阈值时，系统就会发生相变。相反，宗法金字塔的单线差序性为以后的官僚金字塔准备了原型。血缘的尊卑结构解体后，武断的尊卑结构取而代之。在这两种情况下，契约及其解释都是不必要的。	<br><br>
原始礼法类似原始习惯法，犹如草本植物的幼苗出土时类似木本植物的幼苗；但习惯法每隔百年就会上升到新的高度，礼法却始终在相当于、甚至低于周礼的层次上横向蔓延展开。巫师和法学家在起点处相去不远，在终点就无法沟通了。	<br><br>
